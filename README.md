**Changes made from last commit:**

- MVTC now works using DynamicTest
 
**Next tasks:**

- Revise overall application and determine next logical step
 - Consider reworking the functionality for DynamicTest
 - Currently the program only _technically_ uses DynamicTests. It uses assertTrue when the test case is tested using the previous method.

- Remember a TestFactory function should return a collection of DynamicTests which would be called in the main function

- Fix deleting error found from last commit (deleting a file that isn't empty doesn't work)
