## Changes made from last commit

- MyTestFactory.java was renamed to Main.java

- Removed "run" functions from test cases and ASpec as "runDynamicTest" is now used

 
## Next tasks

- Consider making DynamicTest an attribute to all test cases

- Consider renaming getDynamicTest functions for test cases and ASpec

- Handle input (don't accept invalid input)

- MVTC will cause an error if i try to test for a return value on a function that is void. It must be able to handle void functions
 
- Fix deleting error (deleting a file that isn't empty doesn't work)

- Revise project to determine anymore necessary changes before merging with main repository
    
    - Keep SOLID principles in mind and determine if they are adhered to

- **Merge program with main repository**
